SECTION A — SELF-ASSESSMENT (TRAIT-BASED FIRST)

• O*NET Interest Profiler: https://www.onetonline.org/
• VIA Character Strengths: https://www.viacharacter.org/

Note on “type” tests:
They can be fun, but they often lock you into categories.
If you want something more flexible, focus on OCEAN-style traits (you move along a spectrum, not into a box).


SECTION B — CAREER REALITY CHECK (WHAT THE JOB ACTUALLY IS)

• CareerOneStop (global-friendly): https://www.careeronestop.org/
• U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Handbook: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/
• Prospects (UK): https://www.prospects.ac.uk/


SECTION C — COPY/PASTE SEARCH PROMPTS (USE THESE)

1) “Day in the life” prompt:
   day in the life of a [job title] tasks responsibilities stressors favorite parts

2) “What I wish I knew” prompt:
   what I wish I knew before becoming a [job title] + mistakes + reality

3) “Study path” prompt:
   what subjects should I take to become a [job title] in [country]


SECTION D — WARM OUTREACH TEMPLATE (INFORMATIONAL CHAT / SHADOWING)

Subject: Quick question about your work as a [JOB TITLE]

Hi [NAME],

Hope you’re doing well. I’m currently exploring possible study/career paths and your work as a [JOB TITLE] stood out.

I’m trying to understand what the role actually looks like in real life, especially the parts people don’t see from the outside (day-to-day tasks, skills that matter most, what you enjoy, what’s tough).

If you’re open to it, could I ask you 5–10 quick questions over a short call — or even just by message/email?
No pressure at all. Even a few bullet points would help massively.

Either way, thanks for your time — and respect for the work you do.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
