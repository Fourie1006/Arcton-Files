Subject: Quick question about your work as a [JOB TITLE]

Hi [NAME],

Hope your week’s going well. I’m currently exploring possible study and career paths, and I came across your work as a [JOB TITLE].

I’m trying to understand what the role looks like in real life — the day-to-day tasks, the skills that matter most, and what you enjoy (and what’s tougher than people expect).

If you’re open to it, could I ask you a few quick questions?
I can do it by message/email, or we could do a short 10-minute call — whatever is easiest for you.

If there’s any specific area you think I should focus on (e.g., [SKILL 1], [SKILL 2], [TOOL/AREA]), I’d really appreciate your guidance.

Either way, thanks for your time — and respect for the work you do.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[OPTIONAL: SCHOOL / CITY]
