          <p>
            This resource is not designed to tell you what to become.

            Elena’s method was simple:
            map tendencies → translate titles into reality → extract signal with better questions → speak to real people → test assumptions.

            They can be fun. They can be motivating. But they often lock you into categories.
            If you want flexibility, focus on OCEAN-style traits: you move along a spectrum, not into a box.

            “Explain the hidden workload of being a <strong>[JOB TITLE]</strong>. Include the emotional load, decision fatigue, paperwork/admin,
            stakeholder conflict, and the parts people romanticise incorrectly. Then list the trade-offs: what you gain and what you give up.”

            (projects, volunteering, shadowing, short courses, communities).”

          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Quick question about your work as a <strong>[JOB TITLE]</strong></p>

          <p>
            Hi <strong>[NAME]</strong>,<br><br>
            Hope you’re doing well. I’m currently exploring possible study and career paths, and your work as a <strong>[JOB TITLE]</strong> stood out.<br><br>
            I’m trying to understand what the role actually looks like in real life, especially the parts people don’t see from the outside:
            the day-to-day tasks, the skills that matter most, what you enjoy, and what’s tougher than expected.<br><br>
            If you’re open to it, could I ask you <strong>5–10 quick questions</strong> over a short call, or even just by message/email?
            No pressure at all — even a few bullet points would help massively.<br><br>
            If it helps, I’m specifically curious about:<br>
            • What a normal week looks like<br>
            • What you wish you knew early on<br>
            • Which skills matter most (and how you built them)<br>
            • What someone like me could do in the next 30 days to test fit<br><br>
            Either way, thank you for your time — and respect for the work you do.<br><br>
            Best,<br>
            <strong>[YOUR NAME]</strong><br>
