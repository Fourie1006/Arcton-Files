\
          Hey [Name],<br /><br />\
\
          I hope you\'92re doing well. I\'92m exploring different paths after school and I came across your work as a [Job Title].\
          I\'92m genuinely curious about what the role is like in real life, not just what the internet says.<br /><br />\
\
          If you\'92d be open to it, could I ask you a few questions in a quick 10\'9615 minute chat?\
          I\'92m especially interested in how you built skills like [Skill 1] and [Skill 2], and what you think matters most when someone is starting out.<br /><br />\
\
          No pressure at all. Even a few lines by message would help a lot.\
          Thank you for considering it.<br /><br />\

          1) What surprised you most about the job once you started?<br />\
          2) What does a \'93good week\'94 vs \'93bad week\'94 look like?<br />\
          3) What skills matter most day-to-day?<br />\
          4) If you could restart at 17\'9619, what would you do differently?<br />\
          5) What kind of person thrives in this work?<br /><br />\
