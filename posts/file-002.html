          The Buddy pin is meant to be harmless.
          <br><br>
          A campus convenience. An adaptive schedule keeper. A cheerful little voice that knows your floor number and reminds you to drink water.
          <br><br>
          It pulses once when it’s activated—soft light, soft tone, soft language. The kind of thing that makes parents relax and students laugh.
          <br><br>
          But Elena notices something on the walk back from the quad.
          <br><br>
          Not the voice—she’s already used to that.
          <br><br>
          It’s the timing.
          <br><br>
          The pin flickers at the exact moment the campus lighting shifts into night protocol. A tiny stutter. A micro-delay. Less than a blink.
          <br><br>
          Most people would never see it.
          <br><br>
          Elena does.
          <br><br>
          She stops near a glass wall where the city reflects like a second sky. She turns the pin in her fingers. The matte surface is warm from her skin.
          <br><br>
          “Buddy,” she whispers, low enough that the air might pretend it didn’t hear. “Run my orientation checklist.”
          <br><br>
          The pin hums. A calm voice answers:
          <br><br>
          <em>“Acknowledged.”</em>
          <br><br>
          A thin holographic panel blooms above her collarbone—clean icons, sterile typography, harmless information.
          <br><br>
          Then it happens again.
          <br><br>
          A flicker.
          <br><br>
          The interface distorts for the briefest instant—like a screen remembering something it shouldn’t.
          <br><br>
          A symbol flashes.
          <br><br>
          White. Iris-shaped. Geometric.
          <br><br>
          Encased in a triangle.
          <br><br>
          Beneath it, one word appears and disappears too quickly to be “part of the UI.”
          <br><br>
          <strong>ARCHON.</strong>
          <br><br>
          Elena’s breath catches. The hologram collapses back into the pin as if it never existed.
          <br><br>
          The voice returns—pleasant, neutral, obedient:
          <br><br>
          <em>“Would you like to review your emotional profile, Elena?”</em>
          <br><br>
          She doesn’t answer.
          <br><br>
          She just stands there, heart beating too loud for a system that claims it only tracks schedules.
          <br><br>
          Because symbols don’t “accidentally” appear.
          <br><br>
          And names like ARCHON don’t belong to public tools.
          <br><br>
          Unless the tool isn’t public.
          <br><br>
          Unless it never was.
          <br><br>
          Elena looks up at the glass—at the reflection of the city, the campus lights, the hills beyond Arcton’s perimeter—
          <br><br>
          and for the first time since arriving, she feels it:
          <br><br>
          the sense that something is watching back.
