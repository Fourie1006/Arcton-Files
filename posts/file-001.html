          <strong>Recovered Brief:</strong><br>
          This file documents a method Elena used to reduce uncertainty without pretending it didn’t exist.
          You will see four stages: trait-based self-assessment, reality-checking careers, extracting signal with better prompts,
          and warm outreach for informational chats / shadowing.
          <br><br>
          The storyline remains sealed. The method does not.

          <p>The first question is never asked loudly.</p>

          <p>
            It arrives quietly — usually late, usually alone — and it sounds deceptively simple:
          </p>

          <p><strong>“What do you want to do after school?”</strong></p>

          <p>
            For most students, it feels premature. Abstract. Unfair.
            A decision framed as permanent when nothing else in life feels settled yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal records recovered from the Arcton Institute indicate Elena encountered this question early —
            not as pressure from others, but as a tension she couldn’t ignore.
            Instead of rushing toward an answer, she documented a process.
          </p>

          <p>
            She started with a rule most people skip:
            <br><strong>Do not begin with job titles.</strong><br>
            Begin with the self — how you tend to think, respond, focus, and care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Elena wrote down patterns before preferences.
            What energised her. What drained her. What she avoided.
            Then she used two neutral tools — not to label herself, but to generate hypotheses:
            <br>
            • <a class="tile__link" href="https://www.onetonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O*NET Interest Profiler</a>
            <br>
            • <a class="tile__link" href="https://www.viacharacter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIA Character Strengths</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            She noted something else in the margins:
            “Type” tests can be entertaining, but they often lock you into a box.
            Elena preferred a spectrum model — OCEAN-style traits — because people move.
            They don’t stay fixed.
          </p>

          <p>
            (If you want the Arcton-style OCEAN survey Elena used for mapping tendencies, it’s here:
            <a class="tile__link" href="https://forms.gle/jAm5SMhk8xWhMUJZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCEAN Survey — Public Release</a>.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Only after this did she allow job titles onto the page.
            Not “popular careers.”
            Prestigious, visible careers — the ones people mention first because they’re easy to name:
            doctor, lawyer, engineer, marketer, mechanic, pharmacist, psychologist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Elena didn’t ask which one sounded impressive.
            She asked what each one <em>actually</em> is.
          </p>

          <p>
            She used reality-check sources with blunt language and boring honesty:
            <br>
            • <a class="tile__link" href="https://www.careeronestop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CareerOneStop</a> (role summaries + pathways, broadly useful even outside the U.S.)
            <br>
            • <a class="tile__link" href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook</a> (work environment, demand, typical duties)
            <br>
            • <a class="tile__link" href="https://www.prospects.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospects (UK)</a> (clear overviews, entry routes, “is it for you” framing)
          </p>

          <p>
            But reading wasn’t enough. Elena wrote:
            “Descriptions are not experience. They are a doorway.”
          </p>

          <p>
            She began collecting first-hand signal — short conversations with people living inside those roles.
            Not interviews for a job. Interviews for truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            She kept the outreach warm, human, and specific — because asking for time is asking for trust.
            And the message mattered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over weeks, her list didn’t shrink because she found “the one.”
            It shrank because she found friction.
            The kind you only feel when you touch reality:
            the pace of the environment, the emotional load, the repetition, the politics, the stressors no brochure lists.
          </p>

          <p>
            The breakthrough was not a sudden passion.
            It was a pattern:
            Elena consistently lit up when the work involved people and interpretation — not machines and outputs.
          </p>

          <p>
            She kept the conclusion quiet.
            Not a reveal. Not a declaration.
            Just a private line in a notebook:
            <br><strong>“I think I want to understand minds.”</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            That was enough to continue.
